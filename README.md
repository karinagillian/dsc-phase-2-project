# Phase 2 Project 2 Homeowner Reccomendations
Author: Karina


## Overview

In this project, our aim is to provide actionable insights to real estate agents, empowering them to offer informed recommendations to homeowners regarding the potential value enhancement of their properties through strategic renovations. Central to our analysis are key factors such as the number of bedrooms and floors, each of which holds significant sway over the pricing dynamics of residential properties.

By doing a predictive model and using linear regression the aim is to provide the Agents of King County House Sales with clear reccomendations they can pass on to their clients & home owners around what renovations they can do to improve the sale value of their homes.

## Data

This project uses the King County House Sales datase, so only one dataset for this project. 
The data initially needing cleaning by removing null values, reordering where needed, removing columns that were not relavent. This made the data easier to work from and also easier to share the findings in a succinct and clear manner. It was then a matter of separating out the columns with a large number of distinct values before changing categorical variables to dummies, checking for multicollinarity and log transformation.
